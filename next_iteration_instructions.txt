ADMIN DASHBOARD IMPROVEMENTS - TO BE IMPLEMENTED
================================================

## TABLE UI CHANGES

1. Only allow choosing invoice type and status when clicking edit button (to save space)
2. Change column header from 'Reservation #' to 'ID'
3. Change 'Days' column to 'Days past checkout' on 2 lines
4. Add resizable columns (like Google Sheets/Excel) - drag to adjust width on hover
5. Scrollbar styling: white background with light blue border
6. Drag and drop for building access codes to control their order

## INVOICE DETAILS

1. Default service name: 'Apartment Rental' (instead of 'Accommodation')
2. Add option to edit invoice details when clicking edit button (currently missing)

## INVOICE SETTINGS (New Admin Section)

1. Invoice issuer details - provide, edit and save
2. Invoice numbering logic configuration:
   - Define fixed text phrase (e.g., "FAK")
   - Define delimiters (e.g., "-", "/")
   - Define dynamic parts: year, month, rolling number
   - Rolling number format options: 0, 00, 000, 0000, 00000
   - Example: FAK-2025-01/001 means:
     * Fixed: "FAK"
     * Delimiter: "-"
     * Year: "2025"
     * Delimiter: "-"
     * Month: "01"
     * Delimiter: "/"
     * Rolling number: "001" (format: 000)
   - Must end with invoice numbering
   - Option to set starting number for new invoices
   - Automatic duplicate detection (only unique invoice numbers allowed)

## INVOICE DELIVERY CHANGES

1. Remove guest invoice download option from the system
2. Only admin can download and deliver invoice to customer externally (e.g., via email)
3. This enables the invoice correction feature

## INVOICE CORRECTIONS SYSTEM

1. Add "Issue Correction" button next to "New Reservation"
2. Workflow:
   a. Display box/modal to choose reservation ID
   b. Check if invoice has status "Sent to Client"
      - If not, must change to "Sent to Client" first
   c. Display current invoice data
   d. Allow amendments to the data
   e. Check if anything was changed
      - If nothing changed, block issuing correction
   f. Issue correction

3. Invoice versioning:
   - When viewing/downloading invoice with corrections, show all versions:
     * Original invoice
     * Correction 1 (with date issued)
     * Correction 2 (with date issued)
     * etc.
   - View and Download buttons next to each version

4. Naming convention:
   - Original: [invoice_number]
   - First correction: [invoice_number]_CORRECTED
   - Second correction: [invoice_number]_CORRECTED_2
   - Third correction: [invoice_number]_CORRECTED_3
   - And so on...

5. Unlimited corrections allowed (can issue correction on top of correction)
